# MVC Framework

## Features
  - Create views from a single extends.
  - Configure controller and model classes for each view class.
  - No need to create controller and model objects, the instances are automatically generated for you.
  - Log runtime data in .txt files.
  - Configure max file size for the log files.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK version 11 or higher. If don't  have it, you can get one here [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

- Your favorite IDE, for this tutorial I'm going to use VSCode

  

**Step 1.** [Download the jar file](https://github.com/alanmoraales/mvc-framework/releases/tag/0.1) of this library.

**Step 2.** Add the jar to the classpath of your Java project. I'm gonna show you how to do it in VSCode.



###### Adding the library in VSCode

**Step 1.** Install the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) in VSCode.

**Step 2.** Activate the extension by creating a new **.java** (for example *Client.java*)file in your project. You will notice that a "Java Projects" tab is now showing in your side bar. 

![image-20210115021458428](https://i.imgur.com/rdK0KXg.pngg)

**Step 3.** Create a *lib* folder in the root directory of your project and drop the jar file there. This will automatically add the library to you project's classpath.

###### Adding the library in VSCode - Alternative

If for any reason the first method didn't worked, you can try the manual installation.

**Step 1.** Install the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) in VSCode.

**Step 2.** Open the Java projects tab, you'll see your project name inside.

**Step 3.** Open your project, you'll see a Referenced Libraries section and a plus sign, click it and find the jar file.

This is it for the installation part, you should be ready to use the library.


## Usage example
In this example we're gonna build a "Hello world", using the classes provide by the framework.

### Creating a model and a controller
To create a controller you only need to extend your class from Controller class.

````java
import mvc.Controller;

public class HelloWorldController extends  Controller {
  ...
}
````

you can add whatever you want to the class, but for this example we're just gonna have the extends.

To create a model, you extend from the Model class.

````java
import mvc.Model;

public class HelloWorld extends Model {
  public HelloWorld() {
    this.setData("Not Hello World");
  }
}
````

### Creating a view
To build our view we need to extend from the View class.

````java
import mvc.View;

public class HelloWorldView extends View {

  @Override
  public void updateData() {
    String helloWorld = (String) this.model.getData();
    System.out.println(helloWorld);
  }

  public void sayHello() {
    this.modelController.updateModel("Hello World");
  }
}
````
After you extend from View, the compiler will ask you to override the updateData function. This function runs everytime the data in the model updates.
We also defined a sayHello functions, weÂ´re gonna run this function in the main class to update the data in the model and watch the updateData function in action.

#### Adding config to the view
The next step is to connect the view with its corresponding controller and model. To do that, we need to create a properties file with the same name of the view class in the root directory.

![properties-in-root](https://i.imgur.com/mEDqHGD.png)

Inside the file you have to define the controller and model class like this:

````
model=models.HelloWorld
controller=controllers.HelloWorldController
````

Notice that you need to define the package where the class is, like when you make an import.

That's it, when you create a instance of the view, the controller and model class will be automatically created by the framework.

To close the example, here's the main class.

````java
import views.HelloWorldView;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var helloWorldView = new HelloWorldView();
    helloWorldView.sayHello();
  }
}
````

To run the project just go to the main class and click run in the main method.

## The logger

The logger functionality works without any configuration, but you are still able to deactivated or to change the max file size of the generated files. To do it, you just need to created a `log.properties` files in the root directory.

````
activated=true
maxFileSize=3000
````

the maxFileSize represents the max number of bytes a single log file can be.
